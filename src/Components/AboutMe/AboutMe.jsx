        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Raj. Nice to meet you.</p>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack developer passionate about building digital products
          that improve everyday experiences for people. I love working on
          exciting projects that test what I've learned while being exposed to
          the power and potential of the ever-evolving technologies around us. I
          am always on the lookout for better, and more importantly, ethical and
          accessible ways to solve the common problems that we face on a day to
          day basis.
